## Overview

This is a central component [WeNMR](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl), a worldwide
e-Infrastructure for NMR and structural biology - operated by
the [BonvinLab](https://bonvinlab.org) at the [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl).
It is closely coupled with [`jobd`](https://github.com/rvhonorato/jobd),
with more destinations to be added in the future such as:

- [DIRAC interware](https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- Educational cloud services
- SLURM

This is an asynchronous job orchestration system written in Rust that
manages and distributes computational jobs across research software
apps. Its a reactive middleware layer between the backend and various
computing resources, implementing quota-based load balancing.
